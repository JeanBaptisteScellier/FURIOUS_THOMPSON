To test everything:

1. connect to facebook 
adress: 
loveps42@yahoo.com
password:
hackathonparis

2. start a conversation with the page: Ps love hackathon paris
(it's shared on wall)

3. enjoy

I'll let the js code run on my personal server for 2 weeks,
it's difficult to install everything.
So you just have to try it with facebook account
(facebook want https, so you'd have to deal with ngrok)

To install everything

1. git clone the repo
2. install ngrok to have https
3. npm i
4. node index.js or nodemon
5. go to developers.facebook.com
6. click webhook then edit subscription and add the https adress from ngrok
